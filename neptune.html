 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Neptune (29.9–30.5 AU)[D 6] is the furthest planet known in the
Solar System. Its outer atmosphere has a slightly muted cyan color, with occasional storms on the
surface that look like dark spots. Like Uranus, many atmospheric phenomena of Neptune are
unexplained, such as the thermosphere's abnormally high temperature or the strong tilt (47°) of its
magnetosphere. As of 2024, Neptune has 16 confirmed satellites, divided into two groups:
 Regular satellites, which have circular orbits that lie near Neptune's equator.[183]
 Irregular satellites, which as the name implies, have less regular orbits. One of them, Triton, is
Neptune's largest moon. It is geologically active, with erupting geysers of nitrogen gas, and possesses a
thin, cloudy nitrogen atmosphere.</font></p>
