 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Mars (1.38–1.67 AU)[D 6] has a radius about half of that of
Earth.[116] Most of the planet is red due to iron oxide in Martian soil,[117] and the polar regions are
covered in white ice caps made of water and carbon dioxide.[118] Mars has an atmosphere composed
mostly of carbon dioxide, with surface pressure 0.6% of that of Earth, which is sufficient to support
some weather phenomena.[119] During the Mars year (687 Earth days), there are large surface
temperature swings on the surface between −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) to 5.7 °C (42.3 °F). The surface is
peppered with volcanoes and rift valleys, and has a rich collection of minerals.[120][121] Mars has a
highly differentiated internal structure, and lost its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago.[122][123] Mars
has two tiny moons:[124]
 Phobos is Mars's inner moon. It is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km (7
mi). Its surface is very unreflective and dominated by impact craters.[D 7][125] In particular, Phobos's
surface has a very large Stickney impact crater that is roughly 4.5 km (2.8 mi) in radius.[126]
 Deimos is Mars's outer moon. Like Phobos, it is irregularly shaped, with a mean radius of 6 km (4
mi) and its surface reflects little light.[D 8][D 9] However, the surface of Deimos is noticeably smoother
than Phobos because the regolith partially covers the impact craters.[127] </font></p>
