 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Uranus (18.3–20.1 AU),[D 6] uniquely among the planets, orbits
the Sun on its side with an axial tilt >90°. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole
points alternately toward and then away from the Sun.[184] Uranus' outer layer has a muted cyan color,
but underneath these clouds are many mysteries about its climate, such as unusually low internal heat
and erratic cloud formation. As of 2024, Uranus has 28 confirmed satellites, divided into three groups:
 Inner satellites, which orbit inside Uranus' ring system.[185] They are very close to each other,
which suggests that their orbits are chaotic.[186]
 Large satellites, consisting of Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.[187] Most of them have
roughly equal amounts of rock and ice, except Miranda, which is made primarily of ice.[188]
 Irregular satellites, having more distant and eccentric orbits than the other objects.</font></p>
