 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Jupiter (4.95â€“5.46 AU)[D 6] is the biggest and most massive planet
in the Solar System. On its surface, there are orange-brown and white cloud bands moving via the
principles of atmospheric circulation, with giant storms swirling on the surface such as the Great Red
Spot and white 'ovals'. Jupiter possesses a strong enough magnetosphere to redirect ionizing radiation
and cause auroras on its poles.[171] As of 2024, Jupiter has 95 confirmed satellites, which can roughly
be sorted into three groups:
 The Amalthea group, consisting of Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. They orbit substantially
closer to Jupiter than other satellites.[172] Materials from these natural satellites are the source of
Jupiter's faint ring.[173]
 The Galilean moons, consisting of Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa. They are the largest moons of
Jupiter and exhibit planetary properties.[174]
 Irregular satellites, consisting of substantially smaller natural satellites. They have more distant
orbits than the other objects.</font></p>
