 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Mercury (0.31–0.59 AU from the Sun)[D 6] is the smallest planet in
the Solar System. Its surface is grayish, with an expansive rupes (cliff) system generated from thrust
faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.[92] The surface has widely varying
temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F)
during sunlight. In the past, Mercury was volcanically active, producing smooth basaltic plains similar to
the Moon.[93] It is likely that Mercury has a silicate crust and a large iron core.[94][95] Mercury has a
very tenuous atmosphere,
 consisting of solar-wind particles and ejected atoms.[96] Mercury has no natural
satellites.[97]</font> </p>
