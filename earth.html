 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Earth (0.98–1.02 AU)[D 6] is the only place in the universe where
life and surface liquid water are known to exist.[102] Earth's atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen and
21% oxygen, which is the result of the presence of life.[103][104] The planet has a complex climate and
weather system, with conditions differing drastically between climate regions.[105] The solid surface of
Earth is dominated by green vegetation, deserts and white ice sheets.[106][107][108] Earth's surface is
shaped by plate tectonics that formed the continental masses.[93] Earth's planetary magnetosphere
shields the surface from radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining life habitability.[109]
 The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.[110] Its diameter is one-quarter the size of Earth's.[111]
Its surface is covered in very fine regolith and dominated by impact craters.[112][113] Large dark
patches on the Moon, maria, are formed from past volcanic activity.[114] The Moon's atmosphere is
extremely thin, consisting of a partial vacuum with particle densities of under 107 per
cm−3.[115]</font></p>
