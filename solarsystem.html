 <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It
formed about 4.6 billion years ago when
 a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc.
 The solar system is part of the "observable universe," the region of space that humans can actually
or theoretically observe with the aid of technology. 
 Unlike the observable universe, the universe is possibly infinite.The Sun, Moon, and
 brightest planets were visible to the naked eyes of ancient astronomers, and their observations and
calculations of the movements of these bodies gave rise to the science of astronomy. Today the amount
of information on the motions, properties, and compositions of the planets and smaller bodies has
grown to immense proportions, and the range of observational instruments has extended far beyond
the solar system to other galaxies and the edge of the known universe. Yet the solar system and its
immediate outer boundary still represent the limit of our physical reach, and they remain the core of
our theoretical understanding of the cosmos as well. Earth-launched space probes and landers have
gathered data on planets, moons, asteroids, and other bodies, and this data has been added to the
measurements collected with telescopes and other instruments from below and above Earth’s
atmosphere and to the information extracted from meteorites and from Moon rocks returned by
astronauts. All this information is scrutinized in attempts to understand in detail the origin and
 evolution of the solar system—a goal toward which astronomers continue to make great
 strides.</p>
