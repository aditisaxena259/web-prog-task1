 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Saturn (9.08–10.12 AU)[D 6] has a distinctive visible ring system
orbiting around its equator composed of small ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, it is mostly made of
hydrogen and helium.[176] At its north and south poles, Saturn has peculiar hexagon-shaped storms
larger than the diameter of Earth. Saturn has a magnetosphere capable of producing weak auroras. As of
2024, Saturn has 146 confirmed satellites, grouped into:
 Ring moonlets and shepherds, which orbit inside or close to Saturn's rings. A moonlet can only
partially clear out dust in its orbit,[177] while the ring shepherds are able to completely clear out dust,
forming visible gaps in the rings.[178]
 Inner large satellites Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione. These satellites orbit within Saturn's E
ring. They are composed mostly of water ice and are believed to have differentiated internal
structures.[179]
 Trojan moons Calypso and Telesto (trojans of Tethys), and Helene and Polydeuces (trojans of
Dione). These small moons share their orbits with Tethys and Dione, leading or trailing either.[180][181]
 Outer large satellites Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, and Iapetus.[179] Titan is the only satellite in the Solar
System to have a substantial atmosphere.[182]
 Irregular satellites, consisting of substantially smaller natural satellites. They have more distant
orbits than the other objects. Phoebe is the largest irregular satellite of Saturn.[183]
 Uranus (18.3–20.1 AU),[D 6] uniquely among the planets, orbits the Sun on its side with an axial tilt
>90°. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points alternately toward and then
away from the Sun.[184] Uranus' outer layer has a muted cyan color, but underneath these clouds are
many mysteries about its climate, such as unusually low internal heat and erratic cloud formation. As of
2024, Uranus has 28 confirmed satellites, divided into three groups:
 Inner satellites, which orbit inside Uranus' ring system.[185] They are very close to each other,
which suggests that their orbits are chaotic.[186]
 Large satellites, consisting of Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.[187] Most of them have
roughly equal amounts of rock and ice, except Miranda, which is made primarily of ice.[188]
