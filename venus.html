 <p><font face="arial"color="blue">Venus (0.72–0.73 AU)[D 6] has a reflective, whitish atmosphere
that is mainly composed of carbon dioxide. At the surface, the atmospheric pressure is ninety times as
dense as on Earth's sea level.[98] Venus has a surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), mainly due to
the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.[99] The planet lacks a protective magnetic field to
protect against stripping by the solar wind, which suggests that its atmosphere is sustained by volcanic
activity.[100] Its surface displays extensive evidence
 of volcanic activity with stagnant lid tectonics.[101] Venus has no natural satellites.[97]</font> </p>
